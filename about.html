<h3>About Microsoft MVP</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals, or MVPs, are technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with
    the community. They are always on the "bleeding edge" and have an unstoppable urge to get their hands on new,
    exciting technologies. They have very deep knowledge of Microsoft products and services, while also being able to
    bring together diverse platforms, products and solutions, to solve real world problems. MVPs make up a global
    community of over 4,000 technical experts and community leaders across 90 countries/regions and are driven by their
    passion, community spirit, and quest for knowledge. Above all and in addition to their amazing technical abilities,
    MVPs are always willing to help others - that's what sets them apart.
